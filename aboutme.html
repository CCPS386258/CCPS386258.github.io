   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>Something that I am working toward in my personal and professional life is to create time for myself and to challenge myself towards things that are perceieved difficult but possible. I feel like creating time for myself at home or school is vital for my well-being and development as a person. I also feel like putting myself in a mindset, where something is 'difficult' but can be conquered is how I interpret 'challenging' myself. I know that I can learn something through that experience.

The way I am working towards these goals is by balancing my life and priorities. I have recently tried keeping myself organized mentally and physically by doing things in a orderly manner. I also divide my goals into long-term and short-term and determining ideas to being successful within these goals. 

Values that I consider the most necessary for my success includes courage, determination, persistence, and respect. With courage, it can establish a stronger mentatlity. If I am always determined to complete my priorities, it can also build my persistency and how I can be consistent in what I do. Lastly, having respect is a key value that I personally find important.

Short-term goals that I have in mind include studying art in my free time(such as features of a face), improve productivity, and create a comfortable and stable schedule. I choose these goals because I wanted to improve myself overall in a certain section. I love doing art and its one of my favorite hobbies, so currently I wanted to improve on portraits. Also, creating a comfortable schedule would help me balance my life and objectives. Doing those two things have increased my productivity, and I look foward to my growth in my future short-term goals. 

Usually, people don't think of the how a peer may think of you and what traits you reflect. Even so, character traits I want to be percieved within is through my honesty, benevolence, and intuition. I personally feel that these are my three strongest and dependable traits. Achievements that I want to be known for is my artistry and knowledge in various subjects. A great achievement of mine was getting one of my artworks in to a gallery.</p>
